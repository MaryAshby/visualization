    <h1>Visualizations: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly</h1>
        
        <p>Alberto Cairo, in his book, <i>The Truthful Art</i>, quotes Ralph W. Sockman (p. 6): <q>The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder.</q> That is, the more we know, the more we want to know and the more we are able to know. 
        </p>
        <p>
Cairo (p. 45) lists five qualities of a good visualization: it is truthful, it is functional, it is beautiful, it is insightful, and it is enlightening.  I have chosen the following examples to demonstrate how each embodies or rejects the five qualities.

        
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Good</h2>
        <p> This infographic was produced by a site, Graphic News. Graphic News describes itself on the Company website as "an independent news and information agency funded totally by the support received from media publishers and other users of the infographics produced."</p> I chose their infographic on the overcrowding of Mount Everest because it was visually appealing. Once I was lured in with imagery, I learned about the large numbers of people visiting Everest every year.
        Cairo's five qualities:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> It is truthful - the sources were listed at the bottom of the infographic. Visiting the source sites indicates they are good resources with quality data. In addition, anomalies in the data are noted.</li>
        <li>It is functional - the data is set up over a time chart and it is easy to see the increase in climbers. The axies are marked in regular and equal intervals.</li>
        <li> It is beautiful - the type of chart chosen, a bar graph, in addition to the colors used in the chart, reflect the imagery of the mountain in the background. The use of the historic image in the lower left gives balance to the text in the upper right.</li>
        <li> It is insightful - looking at the numbers over a brief period of time would not demonstrate the large increase over the decades. It was interesting to see the difference in numbers between thoses who attempt to reach the summit and those who actually do.</li>
        <li> It is enlightening - looking at the infographic, you can quickly understand the large numbers of people on the mountain each year and that it is leading to overcrowding and dangerous situtations.</li> 
        
    </ul>

        <h2>The Bad</h2>
    <p> This graphic is from the Advocate Messenger newspaper, March 4, 1945. During World War II, there was strict rationing of food as well as food pricing. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) was in charge of keeping food and rent prices down. This graphic shows the point values for a variety of foods. "Points" were ration tokens issued to make change for ration coupons when buying food. Although this chart falls into the <q> bad </q> catagory, other publications from the OPA were beautifully designed by artists in the Works Progress Administration programs.</p>
         <ul>
    <li> It is truthful - Yes, it is, as the OPA set the points.</li>
        <li>It is functional - Yes, it provides inforamtion merchants and customers needed to know about costs.</li>
        <li> It is beautiful - No, it is hard to read and crowded.</li>
        <li> It is insightful - No, it gives no indication as to how the prices had changed.</li>
             <li> It is enlightening - No, it is strictly factual with no additional <q>mind growth</q> information.</li>
    </ul>
